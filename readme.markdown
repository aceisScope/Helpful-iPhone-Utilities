#Helpful-iPhone-Utilities
=============
*Version 1.0*

The original Helpful-iPhone-Utilities is by P.M.Anderson. The main function is to customize UIImagePicker, i.e., put a overlayView on system camera. After taking a photo (which is actually a combination of the photo taken and the overlay on the camera), it will be displayed at the right-bottom corner of window and allowing a single tap and show. 
Based on his work, I rewrote a CustomOverlayViewController and make it possible to select an overlay image for the imagePicker. Added swipedown as dismiss the picker, and shake to switch camera.


Notice:
------------------
Apart from the original files, "CameraOverlayView" is a solo project simply added into this repo.
